#### Mean Stack demo app
The main purpose of this project was to familarize and develop mean app.

The idea of this project is a user can register, login , edit their profile , filter and sort course list.Also the courses are cached. So basically i have tried to use different angularjs features like form, filters, sort, cache,login, listing and detail course as well as user edit and list.

The following objectives were achieved while developing this project.The time allocated is time to familarise the angularjs, nodejs, mongodb, jade, stylus, bootstrap. I had basic understanding of mongodb and angularjs before starting this project.

#### Objective:
* Learn in detail Angularjs
* Learn Nodejs backend with Angularjs
* Integrate MongoDb with Nodejs + Angularjs
* Familiarise with Mean io stack
* Familiarise with stylus and jade + bootstrap

#### Project:
* Make Barebone with nodejs, angularjs, mongodb (3+5+2) = 10
* Heroku Setup and deploy for barebone (1)
* Basic layout UI with Bootstrap and Stylus (4+4+3) = 11
* Authentication and Authorization (6+4) = 10
* Signup (6)
* Profile (4)
* Course List (4)
* Filter and Sort (1)
* Sort (1)

So roughly i have spent 48 hours in this project.
