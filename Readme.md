#### Mean Stack demo app
The main purpose of this project was to familarize and develop mean app.

The idea of this project is a user can register, login , edit their profile , filter and sort course list.Also the courses are cached. So basically i have tried to use different angularjs features like form, filters, sort, cache,login, listing and detail course as well as user edit and list.

The following objectives were achieved while developing this project.The time allocated is time to familarise the angularjs, nodejs, mongodb, jade, stylus, bootstrap. I had basic understanding of mongodb and angularjs before starting this project.
